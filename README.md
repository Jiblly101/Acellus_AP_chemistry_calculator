# Acellus_AP_chemistry_calculator
I don't like Acellus, it's owned by a cult, so I made a calculator to do all the work for me

at my school, I have to use Acellus.com for my science because half of my schools high school staff left, and it is probobly the worst tool to learn, so I said, "well in that
I will make some c++ code to do it all for me"

YES, I know my code is a mess and I want to make it better but I don't know how to use arrays
also, yes I know that I use bools when I should use chars in the beigining, that is because I forgot how to use chars, so yeah
also, yes it it not even close to being any sembelence of doneness








acellus is from a cult, yay.
